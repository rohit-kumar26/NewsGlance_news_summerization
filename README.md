# NewsGlance – News Summarization Project

Welcome to **NewsGlance**, an AI-driven news summarization system that provides concise and coherent summaries of lengthy news articles. This project explores multiple approaches—both **extractive** and **abstractive**—to automatically summarize text using state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

## 1. Project Overview

**NewsGlance** is designed to help users quickly grasp the key information in lengthy news articles. It combines two major text summarization paradigms:

- **Extractive Summarization**: Selecting the most important sentences from the source text.
- **Abstractive Summarization**: Generating new sentences that capture the essence of the original text, much like a human-written summary.

We employ multiple techniques, ranging from simple frequency-based methods to advanced transformer-based models (T5). Our goal is to make news consumption more efficient and user-friendly by providing short, accurate, and coherent summaries.

## 2. Features

- **Multiple Summarization Methods**: 
  - **Extractive**: Frequency-based, TF-IDF-based.  
  - **Abstractive**: RNN with Attention, T5 Transformer.
- **Streamlit Web App**: Easy-to-use interface to input news articles and instantly view summaries.
- **Scalability**: Can be extended to handle larger datasets or integrated into other NLP pipelines.
- **Customizable**: Users can easily tweak parameters such as summary length, threshold scores, etc.

## 4. Methodology

This project implements **four** main approaches to text summarization:

### Extractive Summarization

1. **Frequency-Based Approach**  
   - **Idea**: Rank each sentence by the sum of the normalized frequencies of words in it.  
   - **Pros**: Simple and interpretable.  
   - **Cons**: Might miss context; purely statistical.

2. **TF-IDF-Based Approach**  
   - **Idea**: Convert each sentence to a TF-IDF vector, score them, and pick the top k.  
   - **Pros**: Gives more weight to domain-specific or rare yet important words.  
   - **Cons**: Still bound by original text sentences; lacks paraphrasing.

### Abstractive Summarization

1. **RNN (Seq2Seq) with Attention**  
   - **Idea**: An encoder-decoder framework using GRU or LSTM. The encoder processes the text, and the decoder generates new summary sentences with an attention mechanism.  
   - **Pros**: Produces more human-like summaries than extractive methods.  
   - **Cons**: Can struggle with very long inputs; might generate repetitive or off-topic text.

2. **T5 Transformer**  
   - **Idea**: Fine-tune Google’s T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) model on the CNN/DailyMail dataset.  
   - **Pros**: State-of-the-art performance, powerful pretraining, handles longer context well.  
   - **Cons**: Computationally heavier than RNNs, requires GPU for efficient training.

---

## 5. Dataset

We use the **CNN/DailyMail** dataset, a widely recognized benchmark for news summarization tasks. It contains over 300,000 articles along with human-written “highlights.”

- **Source**: [CNN/DailyMail on HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/abisee/cnn_dailymail)  
- **Structure**:  
  - **article**: Full text of the news article.  
  - **highlights**: Human-written summary (reference).  
- **Splits**: Train / Validation / Test.

You can download the dataset from the link above or directly load it via Hugging Face datasets library:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset("abisee/cnn_dailymail", "3.0.0")
```

---

## 6. Fine-Tuned Model

We have fine-tuned a **T5-small** model on the CNN/DailyMail dataset to improve the abstractive summarization performance. You can find and download our fine-tuned model here:

- **Hugging Face Model Hub**:  
  [Deepanshu7284/t5-small-finetuned-cnn-news](https://huggingface.co/Deepanshu7284/t5-small-finetuned-cnn-news)

Using it is straightforward with the Hugging Face `transformers` library:

```python
from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration

tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained("Deepanshu7284/t5-small-finetuned-cnn-news")
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("Deepanshu7284/t5-small-finetuned-cnn-news")
```

## 7. Installation & Requirements

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/deepanshu-agg/NewsGlance_News-Summarisation-Project.git
   cd NewsGlance_News-Summarisation-Project
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:  
   Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed. Then install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *If `requirements.txt` is missing or incomplete, you may need the following major libraries:*
   - `streamlit`
   - `transformers`
   - `torch`
   - `datasets`
   - `nltk`
   - `scikit-learn`
   - `numpy`
   - `pandas`

3. **(Optional) GPU Setup**:  
   If you plan to train or fine-tune the models, having a GPU (NVIDIA CUDA) is recommended.

---

## 8. How to Run

To launch the **Streamlit** application, navigate to the `StreamlitApp` folder (or the project root, depending on your setup) and run:

```bash
streamlit run highlights_app.py
```

- This command starts a local web server.
- A browser window will open automatically (or you can manually open the URL shown in the terminal, typically `http://localhost:8501`).

---

## 9. Usage

1. **Open the Web App**  
   After running the `streamlit run highlights_app.py` command, your browser should display the NewsGlance interface.

2. **Paste or Enter News Article**  
   - You can paste any news article text into the provided text box.

3. **Select Summarization Method**  
   - **Extractive (TF-IDF)** or **Abstractive (T5)**.  
   - (Some versions of the app may also allow you to select Frequency-based or RNN-based from a dropdown.)

4. **View Summary**  
   - The app will display the summarized text in a matter of seconds.

5. **Compare**  
   - Optionally, you can compare different summaries by toggling between approaches.

---

## 10. Results

We evaluated our approaches using standard metrics such as **ROUGE**, **METEOR**, and **BERTScore**:

- **Extractive (TF-IDF)** consistently outperformed a simple Frequency-based method in ROUGE scores and overall coherence.
- **Abstractive (T5)** significantly outperformed RNN-based abstractive methods in capturing context and producing fluent summaries.

You can refer to the PDF report (`Group_No11_NewsGlance_News_Summarisation_Report.pdf`) for a detailed breakdown of experiments and evaluation metrics.

---

## 11. Future Work

1. **Hybrid Approach**: Combine extractive pre-selection of sentences with abstractive rewriting for improved factual accuracy and fluency.  
2. **Domain-Specific Summarization**: Fine-tune on specialized corpora (finance, medical, legal) to enhance domain-specific summarization quality.  
3. **Multi-Lingual Support**: Extend the pipeline to handle non-English news articles.  
4. **Advanced Evaluation**: Incorporate new metrics that measure factual correctness and coherence more effectively than standard ROUGE.  
5. **Explainable AI**: Provide insights into why certain sentences or phrases are selected/generated to increase transparency.
